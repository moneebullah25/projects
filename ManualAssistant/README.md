## Introduction

Manual Assistant is designed to assist users in extracting meaningful information from uploaded documents. Whether it's querying specific details from a manual or finding relevant content, the tool streamlines the process through document embedding and advanced question-answering capabilities.

## Features

- **Document Embedding:** Utilizes PyPDFLoader, text splitting, and Hugging Face Embeddings for efficient document representation.
- **Vector Search:** Implements Chroma from LangChain to perform similarity searches among embedded documents.
- **Question-Answering Chain:** Sets up a robust question-answering chain with HuggingFacePipeline and PromptTemplate for accurate responses.
- **Streamlit Integration:** Leverages Streamlit for a seamless user experience, allowing document upload and question-answering in a single interface.

## Techniques Used

### Document Embedding

The project employs PyPDFLoader for document loading, text splitting with CharacterTextSplitter, and Hugging Face Embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) for effective document embedding.

### Vector Search

Chroma from LangChain is utilized for vector search, enabling the tool to perform similarity searches among embedded documents efficiently.

### Question-Answering Chain

The question-answering chain is built using HuggingFacePipeline and PromptTemplate, providing a structured approach to handle user queries.

### Streamlit Integration

Streamlit is integrated into the project, offering a user-friendly interface for document upload and seamless interaction with the question-answering capabilities.

### Handling Deprecation Warnings

Deprecation warnings related to LangChain are addressed by replacing the deprecated `__call__` function with `invoke` throughout the codebase.
